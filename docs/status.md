## Known Issues

1. **API Gateway**
   - API Gateway logs are currently not appearing in Cloud Logging
   - The API is accessed via the default Google-provided URL (found in `docs/terraform_outputs.log`), not the custom domain `api-dev.relex.ro`
   - The original end-user's Firebase UID is not automatically propagated to backend functions

2. **Authentication**
   - The `userId` available within the backend function context is the subject ID of the service account, not the original end-user's Firebase UID
   - Backend functions receive the service account identity (`relex-functions-dev@relexro.iam.gserviceaccount.com`)
   - For testing, use the `RELEX_TEST_JWT` environment variable (not `API_AUTH_TOKEN`)

3. **Performance**
   - LLM response times can be variable
   - Large file uploads need optimization
   - Some database queries need indexing

4. **Security**
   - Need to implement rate limiting
   - Additional input validation required for edge cases
   - Security headers to be configured

5. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables for LLM API keys must be properly set during deployment
   - Firestore collection structure and naming is now consistent

6. **Reliability**
   - Agent error handling needs more robust recovery mechanisms
   - Retry logic for external services needed
   - Better logging and monitoring needed
