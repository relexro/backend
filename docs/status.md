## Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - LLM response times can be variable
   - Large file uploads need optimization
   - Some database queries need indexing

2. **Security**
   - Need to implement rate limiting
   - Additional input validation required for edge cases
   - Security headers to be configured

3. **Configuration**
   - Environment variables for LLM API keys must be properly set during deployment
   - Firestore collection structure and naming is now consistent

4. **Reliability**
   - Agent error handling needs more robust recovery mechanisms
   - Retry logic for external services needed
   - Better logging and monitoring needed

## Next Steps
