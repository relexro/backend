  - [x] **Internal Language**: Core agent prompts in `functions/src/agent-config/` (`agent_loop.txt`, `modules.txt`) updated by Operator (Romanian confirmed); obsolete `prompt.txt` confirmed deleted. All internal system prompts & LLM communications to be exclusively in Romanian. (`response_templates.py` & `draft_templates.py` reviewed, no changes needed per language policy; final `agent_loop.txt` polish deferred).
  - [ ] **UI Language**: User interface to support English and Romanian.
  - [x] **User Language Preference**: User profile (`users` collection) stores `languagePreference` ('en'/'ro'). Auto-set from OAuth `locale` on initial user creation via `/v1/users/me`. `GET /v1/users/me` returns this preference. Logic implemented in `functions/src/auth.py` and `functions/src/user.py`, and unit tested in `tests/unit/test_user.py`.
  - [ ] **Translation Layer**: (Future) Implement for user input to Romanian and agent output from Romanian to user's language.
  - [ ] **UI Elements Translation**: (Future) Implement for UI text elements in EN/RO.

## Current System Status

### Latest Updates
---
**Date:** 2025-05-28
**Update:** Successfully resolved several critical bugs and enhanced test robustness. Key changes include:
* Corrected user identification by changing `request.user_id` to `request.end_user_id` in `functions/src/organization.py`, `functions/src/cases.py`, `functions/src/party.py`, and `functions/src/organization_membership.py`.
* Standardized `datetime` usage in `functions/src/organization.py`, `functions/src/organization_membership.py`, and `functions/src/party.py`.
* Fixed Firestore sentinel value serialization in `create_org_in_transaction`, `add_organization_member`, and `set_organization_member_role` functions.
* Resolved Firestore client import issue in `functions/src/auth.py`.
* Added detailed logging to `create_organization` and `_authenticate_and_call` in `main.py`.
* Suppressed test warnings via `pytest.ini` and updated `tests/conftest.py` (SSL verification default, `RELEX_TEST_VERIFY_SSL` env var).
* Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `organization.py` and `party.py`.
As a result, all tests are now passing without warnings, confirming the stability of these fixes.

**Date:** 2025-05-26
**Update:** Implemented comprehensive unit tests for `functions/src/auth.py`, achieving 56% code coverage. Tests cover token validation (`validate_firebase_id_token`, `validate_gateway_sa_token`), user extraction (`get_authenticated_user`), the `requires_auth` decorator, `PermissionCheckRequest` model validation, and foundational permission checking logic (`_check_organization_permissions`, `_check_case_permissions`). Enhanced test fixtures for mocking Firestore interactions with complex scenarios. Remaining coverage gaps include HTTP endpoint functions, `add_cors_headers` decorator, and more detailed permission helper tests.
---
**Date:** 2025-05-24
**Update:** Implemented UI language preference feature in user profiles. User profiles now store `languagePreference` ('en'/'ro') with auto-detection from OAuth `locale` on initial user creation. The preference is returned via `GET /v1/users/me` and can be updated via `PUT /v1/users/me`. Comprehensive unit tests added in `tests/unit/test_user.py`. Also completed review of `response_templates.py` and `draft_templates.py` for Romanian language compliance (no changes needed per language policy).
---
**Date:** 2025-05-22
**Update:** Agent prompting strategy refactored. Consolidated system prompts into `functions/src/agent-config/agent_loop.txt` (content iteratively refined by Operator), implementing SoT/CoT/ToT methodologies, defined personas, Gemini-Grok protocol, and explicit tool/module usage, all in Romanian. Obsolete `prompt.txt` in `functions/src/agent-config/` confirmed deleted. All relevant documentation updated to reflect this architecture.
---
**Date:** 2025-05-20
**Update:** Standardized Python runtime to version 3.10 for all Cloud Functions. Updated all documentation to consistently specify Python 3.10 as the required runtime. This ensures compatibility with Google Cloud Functions and eliminates deprecation warnings that were occurring with Python 3.12+. All tests now run successfully with Python 3.10 without any warnings.
---
**Date:** 2025-05-18
**Update:** End-user identity propagation and user profile creation-on-demand via /v1/users/me endpoint is now fully implemented and tested. The endpoint creates the user profile if missing and returns it, ensuring idempotent and robust user onboarding. This closes the previous gap in user creation and profile retrieval. All related authentication flows are now working as intended.
---

### API Accessibility
- **API Gateway URL**: The API is accessed via the default Google-provided URL found in `docs/terraform_outputs.log` as `api_gateway_url` (e.g., `relex-api-gateway-dev-mvef5dk.ew.gateway.dev`)
- **Custom Domain Status**: The custom domain `api-dev.relex.ro` is NOT currently the active endpoint for the API Gateway

### Test Authentication
- **Authentication Method**: Requires Firebase JWT tokens
- **Token Acquisition**: Use `tests/test-auth.html` (served locally from the `tests/` directory via `python3 -m http.server 8080`)
- **Environment Variables**: Set the obtained tokens as environment variables based on the user role:
  - `RELEX_TEST_JWT`: For regular user tests (no organization membership)
  - `RELEX_ORG_ADMIN_TEST_JWT`: For organization admin tests
  - `RELEX_ORG_USER_TEST_JWT`: For organization staff member tests

### Authentication Flow
1. Client sends Firebase JWT token to API Gateway
2. API Gateway validates this Firebase JWT
3. API Gateway passes end-user claims in the `X-Endpoint-API-Userinfo` header (base64-encoded JSON) to the backend
4. API Gateway generates a new Google OIDC ID Token (using `relex-functions-dev@relexro.iam.gserviceaccount.com` SA identity) to authenticate itself to the backend Cloud Run function
5. The backend function's `auth.py` (`get_authenticated_user`) validates this Google OIDC ID token and extracts the original end-user's Firebase UID from the `X-Endpoint-API-Userinfo` header
6. The business logic in the backend uses this propagated end-user Firebase UID

### Resolved Issues
- **API Gateway Path Routing**: Fixed routing for default URL with `CONSTANT_ADDRESS` path translation - RESOLVED
- **Backend Authentication of Gateway SA**: Properly validating Google OIDC ID token from API Gateway - RESOLVED
- **End-User Identity Propagation**: Implemented extraction of end-user identity from `X-Endpoint-API-Userinfo` header and user creation-on-demand for `/v1/users/me` - IMPLEMENTED & VERIFIED for `/v1/users/me` and related endpoints
- **Cloud Function Health Check Mechanism**: Standardized to use `X-Google-Health-Check` header - IMPLEMENTED
- **User ID Propagation in API Handlers**: Corrected propagation of `end_user_id` (formerly `user_id`) in core API handlers - RESOLVED
- **Datetime Handling Inconsistencies**: Addressed `datetime.datetime` vs `datetime` inconsistencies across multiple modules - RESOLVED
- **Firestore Sentinel Serialization**: Resolved `SERVER_TIMESTAMP` sentinel serialization issues in Firestore transactions - RESOLVED
- **Firestore Client Import**: Fixed duplicate/incorrect Firestore client import and usage in `auth.py` - RESOLVED
- **Test Warnings**: Eliminated `pytest` warnings (Google protobuf, InsecureRequestWarning) via configuration - RESOLVED

### Key Unresolved Issues

1. **API Gateway Logging**
   - Logs are currently not appearing in Cloud Logging despite `roles/logging.logWriter` being granted to the Gateway's Google-managed SA
   - This severely hinders debugging and monitoring of the API Gateway itself
   - Investigation is ongoing to determine the root cause

2. **Performance Optimization Needed**
   - LLM response times can be variable and need optimization
   - Large file uploads need performance improvements
   - Some database queries need indexing for better performance

3. **Security Enhancements Required**
   - Rate limiting needs to be implemented
   - Additional input validation required for edge cases
   - Security headers to be configured

4. **Reliability Improvements**
   - Agent error handling needs more robust recovery mechanisms
   - Retry logic for external services needed
   - Better logging and monitoring needed

## Next Steps

1. **Fix API Gateway Logging Issues**: Investigate why logs are not appearing in Cloud Logging
2. **Comprehensive API Endpoint Testing**: Test all ~37 endpoints for routing, auth, end-user ID logic, and health checks
3. **Review JWT Audience Configuration**: Consider explicit configuration in `openapi_spec.yaml` for clarity
4. **Implement Rate Limiting**: Design and implement rate limiting strategy
5. **Configure Security Headers**: Define and implement required security headers

### Medium Priority
