# Agent Implementation Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the refactoring of the Lawyer AI Agent implementation to achieve a clean separation of concerns between the HTTP interface layer and the core agent logic.

## Changes Made

1. **Standardized HTTP Function in main.py**
   - The `relex_backend_agent_handler` function in `main.py` now uses the standard `_authenticate_and_call` pattern used by other endpoints
   - It delegates to the `handle_agent_request` function in `agent.py`
   - Authentication is now mandatory (`requires_auth=True`), consistent with other protected endpoints
   - This ensures proper security and access control for the agent API

2. **Consolidated Agent Logic in agent.py**
   - The `handle_agent_request` function in `agent.py` now serves as the entry point for the agent
   - It extracts necessary information from the request and delegates to the `Agent` class
   - The `Agent` class encapsulates the core agent logic, including state management and graph execution

3. **Removed Redundant Code**
   - Removed the redundant `agent_handler.py` file
   - Its functionality was already duplicated in `agent.py`

4. **Updated Tests**
   - Created a new test file `test_agent.py` to test the refactored implementation
   - Marked the old `test_agent_handler.py` as deprecated

## Architecture

The refactored architecture follows a cleaner separation of concerns:

1. **HTTP Layer (main.py)**
   - Handles HTTP requests and authentication
   - Delegates to the agent handler function

2. **Agent Handler (agent.py::handle_agent_request)**
   - Parses request data
   - Extracts case ID and user message
   - Uses authenticated user information (user_id, user_email) from the request
   - Performs explicit authorization check to ensure the user has read access to the requested case
   - Returns appropriate error responses (403, 404) if authorization fails
   - Delegates to the Agent class only if authorization succeeds

3. **Agent Core (agent.py::Agent)**
   - Manages agent state
   - Executes the agent workflow graph
   - Interacts with Firestore for persistence
   - Returns structured responses

4. **Agent Graph (agent_orchestrator.py, agent_nodes.py)**
   - Defines the agent's workflow as a LangGraph state machine
   - Implements specialized nodes for different agent tasks

This refactoring ensures that the core agent logic is self-contained within `agent.py` and its related modules, while `main.py` only handles the HTTP interface layer.
