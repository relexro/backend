# Testing and Development Log

This document contains a historical log of all major resolved issues, completed development tasks, and testing milestones for the Relex backend project.

## Resolved Issues

### API Gateway and Authentication
- **API Gateway Path Routing**: Fixed routing for default URL with `CONSTANT_ADDRESS` path translation
- **Backend Authentication of Gateway SA**: Properly validating Google OIDC ID token from API Gateway
- **End-User Identity Propagation**: Implemented extraction of end-user identity from `X-Endpoint-API-Userinfo` header and user creation-on-demand for `/v1/users/me`
- **Cloud Function Health Check Mechanism**: Standardized to use `X-Google-Health-Check` header
- **User ID Propagation in API Handlers**: Corrected propagation of `end_user_id` (formerly `user_id`) in core API handlers

### Data Handling and Storage
- **Datetime Handling Inconsistencies**: Addressed `datetime.datetime` vs `datetime` inconsistencies across multiple modules
- **Firestore Sentinel Serialization**: Resolved `SERVER_TIMESTAMP` sentinel serialization issues in Firestore transactions
- **Firestore Client Import**: Fixed duplicate/incorrect Firestore client import and usage in `auth.py`

### Testing Infrastructure
- **Test Warnings**: Eliminated `pytest` warnings (Google protobuf, InsecureRequestWarning) via configuration
- **Payment Test Infrastructure**: Enhanced test infrastructure for payment processing, including robust `api_base_url` determination and correct `planId` usage
