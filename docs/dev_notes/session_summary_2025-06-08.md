# Session Summary & Key Learnings (as of 2025-06-08)

This document summarizes the major technical findings and decisions from the extensive testing and refactoring session.

## 1. Python Imports
* **Problem:** `ImportError` during test execution.
* **Resolution:** All relative imports within `functions/src` have been refactored to be absolute (e.g., `from functions.src.module import ...`). This is now the required convention for all new code to ensure tests can run reliably from the project root.

## 2. Asynchronous Testing (`pytest-asyncio`)
* **Problem:** `PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning` for `async def` tests.
* **Resolution:** The root cause was twofold:
    1. The `pytest-asyncio` dependency was added to `functions/src/requirements-dev.txt`.
    2. The `asyncio` marker was registered in `pytest.ini`.
    3. All `async def` tests must now be decorated with `@pytest.mark.asyncio` to be executed correctly.

## 3. Stripe Integration Testing (`Test Clocks`)
* **Problem:** Need for true, end-to-end integration tests for subscriptions without direct database manipulation.
* **Resolution:** Implemented a testing strategy using Stripe's **Test Clock** feature.
    * New fixtures `stripe_test_clock` and `stripe_test_customer` in `tests/conftest.py` manage the lifecycle of these Stripe resources.
    * Tests requiring this (e.g., `test_admin_cannot_delete_organization_with_active_subscription`) are marked as `@pytest.mark.slow`.
    * **Known Limitation:** The setup currently requires one direct Firestore write to associate a `stripeCustomerId`. This is marked with a `//TODO` in the test to be replaced by an internal API endpoint in the future.

## 4. Current Blocker: LLM Integration Test Mocking
* **Problem:** 18 tests are failing in `tests/integration/test_llm_integration.py`.
* **Root Cause:** The `process_with_gemini` function in `llm_integration.py` correctly expects a `list` of `HumanMessage` objects. However, the **tests' mocks** are incorrectly configured and are passing a `tuple` to the function, causing a `ValueError` inside the LangChain library.
* **Next Step:** The immediate next task is to debug and fix the `@patch` and `MagicMock` setups within `tests/integration/test_llm_integration.py` to resolve this type mismatch.
