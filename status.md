## Current Status

All implemented functions have been successfully deployed to Google Cloud Functions and are active.

### Working Features
- ✅ **Authentication Integration**: Token validation and user verification is working. All endpoints now have proper authentication with the reusable `get_authenticated_user` helper. The validate_user function now supports CORS for cross-origin requests.
- ✅ **User Profile Management**: Automatic profile creation using Firebase Auth triggers and API endpoints for retrieving and updating user profiles.
- ✅ **Organization Management**: Functions for creating, updating, and managing organization accounts and their users are complete and deployed.
- ✅ **Organization Membership**: Comprehensive membership management with functions for adding members, setting roles, listing members, removing members, and checking user roles within organizations.
- ✅ **Case Management**: Full lifecycle management of cases (create, read, update, archive, delete) is implemented and active.
- ✅ **Dual Case Ownership Model**: Support for both individual user cases (with payment integration) and organization cases (with role-based permissions).
- ✅ **Permission-based Access Control**: All case and file management functions now implement permission checks based on organization roles or individual ownership.
- ✅ **Enhanced Chat**: Enriched context for chat via the new `enrich_prompt` function which adds case context to prompts.
- ✅ **File Handling**: Uploading and downloading files is functional with appropriate permission checks.
- ✅ **Payment Processing**: Core payment functions using Stripe (create_payment_intent and create_checkout_session) are deployed and integrated with individual case creation.
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All Cloud Functions now use environment variables for region configuration instead of hardcoded values, improving maintainability and flexibility.
- ✅ **Role-Based Access Control**: The `check_permissions` function now properly integrates with the Organization Membership model to enforce role-based access controls for organization resources and cases.
- ✅ **Individual Case Access Control**: Permission system updated to handle cases without an organization, restricting access to case owners only.

## Firebase Authentication Setup

To complete the Firebase Authentication setup (this requires manual steps in the console):

1. **Enable Firebase Authentication in the console:**
   - Go to the Firebase console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Select your project: `relexro`
   - Navigate to the Authentication section
   - Click "Get started" if it hasn't been set up yet

2. **Configure Google Sign-in:**
   - In the Authentication section, go to the "Sign-in method" tab
   - Enable Google as a sign-in provider
   - **IMPORTANT**: Configure the OAuth consent screen with appropriate app name, logos, and contact details
   - For local testing, add `localhost` to the authorized domains list
   - Ensure the Web SDK configuration is properly set up with the correct API Key and Auth Domain

3. **Configure Facebook Sign-in (if needed):**
   - In the Authentication section, go to the "Sign-in method" tab
   - Enable Facebook as a sign-in provider
   - Enter your Facebook App ID and App Secret (you'll need to create these in the Facebook Developer Console)

4. **Update Web App Configuration:**
   - In the Project Settings, find the Web App created via Terraform
   - Get the Firebase configuration object that includes apiKey, authDomain, etc.
   - Update your frontend application with this configuration

5. **Important: Configure Cloud Functions Authentication:**
   - Go to the IAM & Admin section in the Google Cloud Console
   - Ensure that the Cloud Functions service account has the Firebase Admin role
   - Add the following to your functions that need authentication:
     ```python
     # Import Firebase Admin SDK
     import firebase_admin
     from firebase_admin import auth, credentials
     
     # Initialize Firebase Admin
     firebase_admin.initialize_app()
     
     # Verify token in your function
     def verify_token(id_token):
         try:
             decoded_token = auth.verify_id_token(id_token)
             return decoded_token
         except Exception as e:
             return None
     ```

6. **Test Authentication:**
   - After manual setup in the console, use the `gcloud auth print-identity-token` command to get a Google ID token
   - Test the token with your API endpoints by including it in Authorization header:
     ```
     curl -X GET "https://europe-west3-relexro.cloudfunctions.net/relex-backend-validate-user" \
       -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"
     ```
   - For testing from a web application, use the test-auth.html utility which handles CORS preflight requests properly

> **Note**: The current authentication setup requires manual configuration in the Firebase console. Terraform has set up the necessary infrastructure, but the OAuth credentials and provider-specific configuration must be completed in the console.

## Best Practices
- Using Terraform for infrastructure as code ensures consistent deployments
- Authentication and validation is handled for all endpoints
- Error handling and input validation is implemented for all functions
- Firestore is used for data storage with appropriate collection structures
- Environment variables used for configuration instead of hardcoded values
- CORS support added for web application integration
- Role-based access control implemented for organization resources and cases
- Permission checks integrated into all resource-related functions

## Pending Tasks
- ⬜ Implement Stripe webhook handler to process payment events
- ⬜ Set up proper security rules for Firestore
- ⬜ Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- ⬜ Implement user management functions

## Issues
- None currently. All identified issues have been resolved.

## Testing
- Manual testing confirms all deployed functions are working properly
- Authentication is correctly integrated with endpoints and has been successfully tested with Firebase
- The `test-auth.html` utility successfully authenticates users via Google Sign-in and validates tokens with the backend
- CORS support has been verified with preflight requests
- The business module functions are correctly handling CRUD operations
- Chat enhancement with enriched context is functioning as expected
- Payment processing integration with Stripe is working as expected
- The updated `check_permissions` function correctly evaluates permissions based on user roles in organizations
- Permission-based access control has been tested for all case and file management functions
- The permission model has been successfully deployed to all Cloud Functions and verified to be active

## Next Steps
1. Complete the payment processing module by adding the webhook handler
2. Add comprehensive testing for all functions
3. Set up proper security rules for Firestore
4. Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring

All functionality requested in the original plan has been implemented and deployed successfully. The system now ensures that case and file management operations respect the permission model based on organization roles.
