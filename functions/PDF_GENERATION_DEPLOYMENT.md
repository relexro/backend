# PDF Generation for Cloud Functions

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented PDF generation in Cloud Functions using `xhtml2pdf`, a pure Python library without system dependencies.

### Components Successfully Deployed:

1. `pdf-generator` function - A minimal test function that proves the concept:
   - URL: https://europe-west1-relexro.cloudfunctions.net/pdf-generator
   - Successfully generates PDFs from HTML
   - Uses `xhtml2pdf` instead of `weasyprint`
   - Runs in the Cloud Functions environment

### Components Still Pending:

1. Main `relex-backend-agent-handler` function deployment:
   - Currently failing health checks
   - May need further debugging on initialization issues

## Implementation Details

### PDF Generation Solution

We replaced `weasyprint` (which has system dependencies) with `xhtml2pdf` (pure Python):

```python
# Before (with weasyprint - problematic for Cloud Functions)
from weasyprint import HTML
# ... 
pdf_bytes = HTML(string=html_content).write_pdf()

# After (with xhtml2pdf - works in Cloud Functions)
from xhtml2pdf import pisa
import io
# ...
pdf_output = io.BytesIO()
pisa_status = pisa.CreatePDF(html_content, dest=pdf_output)
pdf_bytes = pdf_output.getvalue()
```

### Successful Testing

The PDF generation functionality has been tested and works in:
1. Local environment
2. Deployed Cloud Function (the minimal test function)

### Deployment Scripts

We have a single deployment script:
1. `deploy.sh` - Deploys the agent handler with PDF generation capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Debug health check issues with the main function:
   - Check logs for startup errors
   - May need to split into smaller functions
   - May need application architecture changes

2. Complete deployment:
   - Once health check issues are resolved, deploy the full solution
   - Verify PDF generation in the production environment

3. Monitoring and logging:
   - Enhanced logging has been added to track PDF generation
   - Monitor for any issues in production

## Additional Notes

- We must use `xhtml2pdf` instead of `weasyprint` for Cloud Functions.
- The deployment environment should have Python 3.9+ for best compatibility.
- The PDF generation is now properly integrated into the agent tools.
- The solution is pure Python and requires no system dependencies.
